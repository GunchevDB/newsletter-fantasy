# Simple Newsletter App

A production-ready newsletter builder and API that lets you create polished campaigns, manage subscribers, and embed signup forms on any website. The backend uses Express, Cloudinary, Resend, and Vercel KV for a portable storage layer.

## Features
- Rich text editor with image uploads (optimized & hosted on Cloudinary) and live email previews.
- Sanitized content pipeline with per-subscriber unsubscribe links and plaintext fallbacks.
- Public subscription/unsubscription API with CORS `*` support, rate limiting, honeypot detection, and detailed logging.
- Built-in unsubscribe confirmation page (`/unsubscribe`) and a ready-to-copy HTML example form (`public/example-form.html`).
- Robust email diagnostics: per-recipient logging, delivery summaries, `/api/test-email`, `/api/test-subscribe`, `/api/diagnostics`, and Cloudinary/Resend connectivity checks.
- Subscriber storage backed by Vercel KV in production with an automatic in-memory fallback for local development.

```

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- Resend API key with a verified sender address
- Cloudinary account (free tier works great)
- (Optional) Vercel KV database. On Vercel, the `KV_*` environment variables are provisioned automatically when the KV integration is linked.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in every value (all are required during startup):
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   SENDER_EMAIL=Your Name <you@example.com>   # Must be verified in Resend
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   APP_URL=http://localhost:3000              # Update to your production URL when deployed
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=$2b$12$replace_with_bcrypt_hash
   SESSION_SECRET=super_secret_session_key_change_me
   # Optional: Vercel KV credentials (falls back to in-memory storage if omitted)
   KV_REST_API_URL=
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
   KV_URL=                               # Only needed for direct Redis connections
   ```
   The server refuses to boot if anything is missing or if `SENDER_EMAIL` is malformed, so you catch configuration issues right away. For local development you may keep `ADMIN_PASSWORD` as plain text—the server hashes it at runtime—but in production you should store a bcrypt hash (see below). When the storage variables are missing, the app logs that it is using in-memory storage (ideal for local development).

3. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # nodemon with reload
   # or
   npm start     # plain node
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) to authenticate with your admin credentials; after logging in you will be redirected to the editor dashboard.

## Using the App
1. Sign in at `/login` using the credentials defined by `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
2. Add subscribers manually in the dashboard (or through the public API described below).
3. Compose a campaign: write a title, optional preview text, format content, and upload images.
4. Click **Preview Email** to see the responsive, inline-styled template with the unsubscribe link preview.
5. Click **Send Newsletter** to deliver a personalized email (including a per-recipient unsubscribe link) to each subscriber. Detailed results are returned in the response and logged server-side.
6. Use `/api/test-email` or `/api/diagnostics` whenever you need to verify deliverability or check external integrations (Resend/Cloudinary).

## Subscriber Storage

### Local development
- If the `KV_*` variables are not present, the server automatically switches to an in-memory `Map`. Subscriber data resets whenever the process restarts, which keeps local testing simple.
- To exercise Vercel KV locally (or from another environment), set `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` in `.env`. You can copy these values from Vercel (Project -> Storage -> KV -> Tokens) or create a separate KV instance for local testing.
- When the server boots, check the console output. It logs whether it is using Vercel KV (REST API) or in-memory storage.

### Production on Vercel
- Vercel attaches `KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` automatically when you add the KV integration to your project. No code changes are required.
- Ensure the Storage integration is linked to each environment (Production/Preview/Development) where you deploy. Redeploy after linking so the environment variables become available.

### Verifying Vercel KV
1. Deploy (or run locally with KV credentials) and watch the startup logs for `Subscriber storage configured to use Vercel KV (REST API).`
2. Add a test subscriber via `/api/subscribers` or the dashboard UI.
3. Call `GET /api/subscribers` and confirm the subscriber appears with `subscribedAt`.
4. From the Vercel dashboard, open **Storage -> KV -> Browser** and verify a hash exists under `newsletter:subscriber:<normalized-email>` with the expected fields.
5. Run `GET /api/diagnostics` to see the storage mode and subscriber count summary returned in JSON.

### Migrating existing `subscribers.json` data
If you previously stored subscribers in `data/subscribers.json`, you can seed the KV database with a simple script:

```bash
node - <<'NODE'
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { createClient } = require('@vercel/kv');

const SUBSCRIBERS_SET_KEY = 'newsletter:subscribers';
const SUBSCRIBER_HASH_PREFIX = 'newsletter:subscriber:';

function normalizeEmail(value) {
  return value.trim().toLowerCase();
}

(async () => {
  const file = path.join(__dirname, 'data', 'subscribers.json');
  const payload = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8'));
  const kv = createClient({
    url: process.env.KV_REST_API_URL,
    token: process.env.KV_REST_API_TOKEN,
  });

  for (const subscriber of payload) {
    const normalized = normalizeEmail(subscriber.email);
    if (!normalized) continue;
    const hashKey = `${SUBSCRIBER_HASH_PREFIX}${normalized}`;
    const subscribedAt = subscriber.subscribedAt || subscriber.joinedAt || new Date().toISOString();

    await kv.sadd(SUBSCRIBERS_SET_KEY, normalized);
    await kv.hset(hashKey, {
      email: subscriber.email,
      subscribedAt,
      joinedAt: subscribedAt,
      ...(subscriber.name ? { name: subscriber.name } : {}),
      ...(subscriber.source ? { source: subscriber.source } : {}),
    });
  }

  console.log(`Imported ${payload.length} subscribers into Vercel KV.`);
})();
NODE
```

Ensure `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` are available in your environment before running the script.

## Authentication & Sessions
- The admin interface is protected by a password gate at `/login`. Credentials come from `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- Sessions are backed by `express-session` with a 24-hour idle timeout; selecting “Remember me” extends the cookie to 30 days.
- Login attempts are rate limited (5 per 15 minutes per IP). When the limit is exceeded the form is locked temporarily and a warning is logged.
- The login form is protected with a CSRF token; unauthenticated API calls respond with HTTP 401 so the client can redirect back to `/login`.
- Passwords should be stored as bcrypt hashes in production. Generate one with `npx bcrypt-cli "your-strong-password"` (or any bcrypt tool) and place the resulting hash in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- `SESSION_SECRET` must be a long, random string. Rotate it whenever credentials change to invalidate all sessions.
- For production, swap the default in-memory session store for something durable such as Redis (e.g., `connect-redis`). Redis also satisfies Vercel’s stateless requirements.
- Need multiple admin users? Extend the auth middleware to load a hashed credential list from a secure data store (KV, Redis, or a managed secret) and compare via bcrypt.
- Use `/logout` or the “Logout” button in the navigation to terminate the session. When a session expires naturally the app redirects back to `/login` and preserves the originally requested URL.

## Storage Diagnostics
- Call `GET /api/debug/storage` while authenticated to see the active storage backend, connection health, last subscriber operation, and the current subscriber list.
- Watch the `[Subscribers]` log entries locally or in Vercel logs (`vercel logs <project-name> --since 1h` or Deployments ➝ Logs). Successful writes include the storage mode and updated counts.
- After adding or removing a subscriber in the UI you should see a green “saved” message describing the storage backend and verification attempts. Refresh the page to confirm the subscriber list persists when Vercel KV is available.
- If the app falls back to in-memory storage you will see warnings in the logs. On Vercel, double-check that `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, and `KV_URL` are configured for the active environment.
- For deeper validation, open Vercel ➝ Storage ➝ KV ➝ Browser and look for hashes named `newsletter:subscriber:<email>` updating as you add or remove subscribers.

## Public Subscription API
These endpoints are designed for external sites (e.g., your GoDaddy pages) and accept cross-origin requests.

### CORS and rate limits
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`
- Rate limit: 10 requests per IP per hour on `/api/public/*`

### Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/public/subscribe`   | Adds a subscriber (`{ email, name? }`)      |
| POST   | `/api/public/unsubscribe` | Removes a subscriber (`{ email }`)          |
| GET    | `/api/test-subscribe`     | Health and usage hints for the public API   |

#### Subscribe
Request body:
```json
{
  "email": "alex@example.com",
  "name": "Alex Example",
  "honeypot": ""
}
```
Responses:
- Success: `200 { "success": true, "message": "Successfully subscribed!" }`
- Duplicate: `200 { "success": false, "error": "Email already subscribed" }`
- Validation/other errors return `success: false` with a helpful message.

#### Unsubscribe
Request body:
```json
{
  "email": "alex@example.com"
}
```
Responses:
- Success: `200 { "success": true, "message": "Successfully unsubscribed" }`
- Missing entry: `200 { "success": false, "error": "Email not found" }`

### Example form
The file `public/example-form.html` contains a complete HTML/CSS/JS example you can drop into any site. Update the `API_BASE` constant inside that file to point to your deployed server. The honeypot field is included to deter bots.

## Unsubscribe Flow
- Every newsletter includes a subscriber-specific link (`${APP_URL}/unsubscribe?email=<encoded-email>`).
- `/unsubscribe` serves `public/unsubscribe.html`, a simple confirmation page that calls the public unsubscribe API and displays success/error states.
- You can customize the page styling, but keep the JSON call intact for consistency.

## Deployment Guide

### Environment checklist
Confirm these variables are set in your hosting platform:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `SENDER_EMAIL`
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `APP_URL` (e.g., `https://newsletter.example.com`)
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (bcrypt hash recommended)
- `SESSION_SECRET` (long, random string)
- `KV_REST_API_URL` (auto-provisioned when the Vercel KV integration is linked)
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (auto-provisioned when the Vercel KV integration is linked)
- `KV_URL` (optional; only required for direct Redis connections)

### Vercel
1. Create a new Vercel project from this repo.
2. Set the environment variables (Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables). Provide `ADMIN_USERNAME`, a bcrypt-hashed `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and a strong `SESSION_SECRET`. Once the KV integration is attached, Vercel adds the `KV_*` values automatically.
3. Use `npm install` as the build command and `npm start` as the run command.
4. Redeploy and check:
   - `GET /health`
   - `GET /api/test-subscribe`
   - `POST /api/test-email` with a known inbox

### Railway (or similar platforms)
1. Deploy the repository.
2. Add the environment variables under **Variables**.
3. Use `npm start` as the start command.
4. Ensure port `3000` is exposed.

> `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` is already enabled for accurate IP-based rate limiting behind proxies.

## Diagnostics and Testing
- `GET /health` – basic service uptime.
- `GET /api/test-subscribe` – verify the public API is reachable (useful for CORS checks).
- `POST /api/test-email { testEmail, includeImage? }` – send a diagnostic email; the response includes Resend metadata, timing, DNS/SPF/DKIM hints, and full logging.
- `GET /api/diagnostics` – returns sender info, subscriber counts, Resend/Cloudinary status, last email summary, storage mode, and recent suspicious activity counts.

## Troubleshooting
- **Startup fails** – Check the console; missing or malformed `.env` configuration halts the server.
- **Image upload fails** – Verify Cloudinary credentials; check `/api/diagnostics` for the latest ping result.
- **Resend rejects the email** – Inspect the response for `statusCode`, `error`, and `suggestions`. Common causes: unverified sender, missing domain DNS (SPF/DKIM), or quota limits.
- **Public API returns 429** – You hit the 10 requests/hour/IP rate limit; slow down or aggregate submissions.
- **CORS blocked** – Confirm your frontend is sending `Content-Type: application/json` and that you are hitting the correct API base URL.
- **Subscriber storage unavailable** – Ensure the `KV_*` variables are present and correct. The server logs and `/api/diagnostics` response will call out connection issues.

## Server API Quick Reference
- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/subscribers`
- `POST /api/subscribers { email, name? }`
